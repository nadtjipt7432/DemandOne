/**
 * DemandOne v2 design tokens — calm, legible, light by default, with a manual dark
 * toggle (see You → Settings). One restrained accent (plus one warm second accent),
 * warm neutrals in both palettes, function-based radius (controls vs. surfaces vs.
 * genuine toggles — not one border-radius applied everywhere). No gradients/glows.
 * The product's intelligence shows up in what it does, not in how the screen looks.
 *
 * `colors` is deliberately a plain mutable object, not a value picked by a hook —
 * nearly every screen does `import { colors } from '@/theme'` and reads `colors.bg`
 * etc. inline at render time. `applyThemeMode` reassigns its properties in place
 * (same object reference) so every one of those inline reads picks up the new
 * palette on the next render, with no per-screen changes needed. The one thing this
 * can't fix is a color baked into a module-level `StyleSheet.create` (evaluated once
 * at import) — those few spots (`base.tsx`, `domain.tsx`) compute their styles in a
 * function called per-render instead, for exactly this reason.
